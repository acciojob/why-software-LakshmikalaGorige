	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p> I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and the infinite possibilities it offers. As I delved deeper into the digital realm, I discovered the power of software development to create solutions, bring ideas to life, and transform the way we live and work. This realization ignited a strong passion within me to become a software developer.

        Software development is a unique field where creativity, problem-solving, and innovation converge. It allows me to build something from scratch, shape the future, and make a positive impact on the world. Whether it's creating a mobile app that simplifies daily tasks, designing a website that connects people, or developing software that improves efficiency in various industries, the potential is limitless.

        Furthermore, I'm drawn to the constantly evolving nature of software development. In this field, learning is a never-ending journey.</p>
